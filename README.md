## What is Data Science for Social Good? 
The Data Science for Social Good program, administered through the [University of British Columbia Data Science Institute](https://dsi.ubc.ca/apply-dssg-program), is a 14 week fellowship program aimed at developing solutions to problems with social impact while providing data science training to UBC graduate and undergraduate students. UBC students partner with organizations in the community to work on data science projects that contribute to the public good. To greatly enrich the research experience, the program aims to recruit fellows from a diversity of fields. This particular project partners with Metro Vancouver to determine how biodiversity data can be made easily accessible to regional planners to assist in making land-use decisions.
